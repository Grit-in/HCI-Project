# Terry Bogard Frame Data

This is a placeholder for the Terry Bogard frame data PDF document.

In a real implementation, this would be an actual PDF file with:
- Complete frame data table
- Move properties
- Cancel options
- Frame advantage data
- Hitbox information

For now, this serves as a demonstration of document linking functionality.
